## 🌍 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion causes **time loss, fuel waste, pollution, and stress**. Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timers and **ignore real-time road conditions**.

**SmartTrafficOptimizer** dynamically optimizes traffic signals using **AI, computer vision, and live data** to reduce congestion and improve flow.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Real-time traffic density detection
✅ Intelligent signal timing optimization
✅ Computer Vision–based vehicle counting
✅ Emergency vehicle priority handling 🚑🚓
✅ Historical data analysis & prediction
✅ Scalable & modular architecture

```

1. Capture live traffic feed or dataset
2. Detect & count vehicles using CV
3. Analyze congestion level
4. AI model decides optimal green/red timing
5. Signals update dynamically
